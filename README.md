# Word Embedding from Scratch ðŸ§ 

This project implements a simple word embedding system using a basic neural network â€” no external libraries like Gensim or Word2Vec.

##  What It Does
- Takes a small corpus of sentences
- Creates one-hot encoded vectors
- Trains a neural network to generate word embeddings
- Compares similarity between word vectors

##  Why Built It
To deeply understand how word embeddings work under the hood in NLP.

##  Sample Output
Word embeddings after training (values shortened):
